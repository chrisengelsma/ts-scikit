# How to contribute

Thank you for reading this, we are always in need of volunteer developers to help this project remain strong.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code, and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two (2) spaces (soft tabs)
  * We always line break if the code exceeds 78 columns in width.
  * We document every public and protected method using official jsdoc documentation.
  * We use standard camelCase nomenclature for methods and variables.
  * Private methods and fields begin with an underscore.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code and make it legible for them.
  
Thank you!
